make me a react component which is a float 32 bitflip demo. So by default it will generate a random number from -1 to 1 which represents a weight. It will then represent that number in float32 written but each number is in a little square. 

when you click on one of the boxes, it bitflips it, and it recalculates the decimal number. 

The aim is to showcase how big of an impact bitflipping one of the bits of a float32 can have
